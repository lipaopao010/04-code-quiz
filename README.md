# 04-code-quiz

In this project, I bulid a times code quiz app using javascript.This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It also features a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The details are listed below:
GIVEN the user is taking a code quiz,
WHEN they need to click the start button,
THEN a timer starts and the user is presented with a question.
WHEN they answer a question,
THEN another question is presented.
WHEN they answer a question incorrectly,
THEN time is subtracted from the clock by 10 seconds.
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0,
THEN the game is over.
WHEN the game is over,
THEN the user can save my initials and score.
